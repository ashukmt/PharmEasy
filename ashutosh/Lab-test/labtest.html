            PharmEasy takes safety of our patients and staff very seriously. 
            Which is why since the onset of COVID-19, we formulated a 5-step safety program to offer 100% protection

        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="infoDiv-2">
        <p><b>Are the phlebotomists sufficiently qualified?</b></p>
        <p>
            PharmEasy owns 18 state-of-the-art diagnostic laboratories in the country with an inhouse fleet of 500 phlebotomists across 2500+ pincodes. We have a dedicated training team for the technicians which constantly track their performance on parameters like on time arrival, painless collection, adherence to NABL guidelines for sample storage & transport and customer support.

        </p>
    
    </div>

    <div id="infoDiv-3">
        <p><b>How efficient is the sample collection and analysis process?</b></p>
        <p>
            Utmost care is taken to collect samples while maintaining complete hygiene. Only new and fresh collection kits and needles are used. After collection, the sample is immediately transferred into an icebox to prevent degradation and bacterial build-up which may lead to inaccurate diagnosis. The samples are barcode tagged to prevent mix up and in the laboratories, technicians use high-end, state-of-the-art devices to analyse the samples. 
        </p>
    
    </div>

    <div id="infoDiv-4">
        <p><b>Why are lab tests essential?</b></p>
        <p>
            Lab tests or diagnostic tests are recommended by doctors when they suspect that there might be something wrong with your health. Samples of your blood, stool, urine, or mucus can reveal a lot about the state of your health when analysed with special devices. Once the problem is detected, your doctor can diagnose and put you on medication or suggest a course of treatment.
        </p>
    
    </div>

    <div id="infoDiv-5">
        <p><b>How long does it take for the report to be delivered?</b></p>
        <p>
            It takes 24-48 hours for the lab to prepare your report and have it delivered to you.
        </p>
    
    </div>

    <div id="infoDiv-6">
        <p><b>How should one prepare for a labtest?</b></p>
        <p>
            Different tests have different requirements. Some may need to be on an empty stomach whereas, for some other tests, you may need to consume food before the sample is collected. Speak with your doctor regarding what you need to do to prepare for a lab test. Let your doctor know if you are already on any medication.
        </p>
    
    </div>

    <div id="infoDiv-7">
        <p><b>How are lab tests reports interpreted?</b></p>
        <p>
            The reports that our labs will deliver to you will be quite detailed. There will be charts of reference ranges to help you understand the report and a statement from a qualified doctor. But, once you receive your report, it is best to consult your doctor and ask him/her to explain it to you.
        </p>
    
    </div>

    <div id="infoDiv-8">
        <p><b>If the lab tests result are within normal range,does that mean no illness has been  detected?</b></p>
        <p>
            If your reports are within normal range, it is certainly good news. But normal results do not always give you a clean bill of health. If symptoms persist, your doctor will recommend other tests to detect what is triggering the unusual signs. 
        </p>
